// Committing idle when an FRO session ENDS (manual sign-out or the shift-end
// auto-logout sweep).
//
// Why this exists: while someone is sitting idle, today_idle_seconds holds only
// COMMITTED time and the running stretch lives in idle_since. Every read adds
// them together, so the numbers on screen are always right — but the *stored*
// day total, and therefore the fro_daily_stats row the monthly salary total
// sums, only ever sees the last value a heartbeat happened to write. If a
// session ends while a period is still open, that tail is missing from the
// monthly figure. Both exit paths call this so nothing is lost.
//
// capMs optionally clamps the open period to a known shift end, so the
// auto-logout sweep (which fires shift-end + grace) cannot credit idle for the
// grace minutes after the officer had already gone home.

// Stamping idle the moment the disposition window lapses.
//
// today_idle_seconds only ever holds COMMITTED time, and the running stretch
// lives in idle_since — which is only written by a status push. There is no
// heartbeat, so an FRO who lets the window lapse and then leaves the app
// untouched keeps a row with a lapsed deadline and idle_since = NULL. Reads
// recover the stretch from the deadline, so the number on screen is right, but
// the STORED total stays at whatever it was (often 0). Anything reading the
// stored column — the NGO-admin board, fro_daily_stats, the monthly salary
// total — then disagrees with the strip by however long the officer sat there.
//
// This closes that gap by writing the stamp at the moment the deadline passes,
// so the row's own arithmetic matches the derived one. It is deliberately
// idempotent and never double counts: idle_since is set to the deadline, which
// is exactly where idlePeriodStartMs already begins counting, so a later commit
// banks the identical span.
