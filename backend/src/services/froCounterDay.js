/**
 * Which IST day do a live-status row's counters belong to, and has that changed?
 *
 * The bug this exists to end
 * -------------------------
 * fro_live_status is ONE row per worker carrying "today" counters, and every idle
 * write path stores it with GREATEST, so a stored value can only ever rise. The
 * day rollover used to clear those counters through a condition that only fired
 * when the worker was in an OPEN idle period at the boundary:
 *
 *     if (cleaned.idle_since === null && row.idle_since) payload.today_idle_seconds = 0;
 *
 * Finish a day with idle_since = NULL — resume, sign out, or the exit path banking
 * the period — and the reset never ran. Yesterday's total stayed in the counter,
 * today's idle was added on top of it, and the daily snapshot captured the running
 * total as one day. That is how 52h19m of idle ended up in a single row, and
 * because the snapshot is also GREATEST the value could never be walked back down.
 *
 * The rule now
 * ------------
 * A counter belongs to the day stamped in stats_date, full stop. If that is not
 * today, the old counters are snapshotted against the OLD day and the live row
 * starts today at zero. The rollover no longer consults idle_since at all, so it
 * cannot be skipped by whichever state the worker happened to leave behind.
 *
 * NOTE ON WHAT IS *NOT* DONE HERE. The previous day's counters are banked, not
 * discarded, because they are real shift time and the monthly salary figure sums
 * them. Deliberately not fixing up the historical inflation: that is a data
 * decision, not a code one.
