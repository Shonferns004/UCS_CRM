// and getOfficeEnd EACH independently re-fetched the same worker row with
// select('*'), and each could fall through to a settings read. For a 50-FRO board
// that is ~250 round-trips against a pool capped at 5 connections, every time a
// browser tab polls (10s interval, one request per open tab). The queueing behind
// a 5-connection pool is what made /ngo-admin/tl-dashboard take ~16s, and that
// endpoint is the single largest CPU consumer on the host.
//
// This does the same arithmetic in JS from three queries total, and reads each
// worker row exactly once. Same fallback order as the single-worker version:
// punch_in_time wins when it is from today, otherwise the configured shift, and
// office hours are only consulted when the worker has no shift of their own.
//
