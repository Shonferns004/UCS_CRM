/**
 * Global message search for agents: the same SearchService, scopes and limits as `GET /api/search`.
 *
 * `search` is undefined when SEARCH_ENABLED=false leaves SearchModule out. The tool is still
 * registered, so the published tool surface (and the counts the README states) does not depend on
 * configuration; calling it answers 501, as the REST route answers 404 then.
 *
 * `containsEnabled` is SEARCH_CONTAINS_ENABLED. With it on, `match` defaults to contains, unlike REST
 * (word): an agent often knows only part of a word or types it without accents. Contains does not run
 * every query word does (two-character words alone, as most Korean and many CJK words are, give the
 * trigram index nothing to look up, and the terms together are bounded), so a query it refuses for its
 * terms runs as a word search, as does one while its index is not ready. With it off the built-in
 * provider answers 501 to contains, so the tool defaults to word like REST.
