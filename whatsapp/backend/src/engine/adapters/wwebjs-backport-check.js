 * Startup guard for the whatsapp-web.js message-id backport that scripts/patch-wwebjs-201832.js
 * applies at install time.
 *
 * WhatsApp Web 2.3000.x renamed the serialized message-id property `id._serialized` to `id.$1`.
 * whatsapp-web.js 1.34.7 still reads the old name, so an install that never received the backport
 * breaks opaquely once WhatsApp Web serves that shape: a send resolves with no message object at
 * all (the gateway then refuses to report a delivery it cannot confirm) and chat and media reads
 * throw the minified `r: r` (#889). None of those errors name their cause.
 *
 * The install already warns when it skips the patch, but that is one line in a full `npm install`
 * transcript, and the symptom only appears later, when WhatsApp Web rolls a build that carries the
 * rename. So restate it on the machine that is actually broken, as the engine starts.
 *
 * The marker is the patcher's own stand-down predicate, so the two can never disagree about what
 * "patched" means.
